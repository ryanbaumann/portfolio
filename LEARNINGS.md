# Repository Learnings

This log captures durable lessons discovered while building and maintaining the portfolio and demo lab, keeping the root instructions lean.

## 2026-07-16 - Agent instructions and executable scripts need separate namespaces

Context: The repository already used `scripts/` for executable build and maintenance programs, while a growing collection of copyable agent prompts also needed a memorable GitHub home.
Learning: Store prompts, role contracts, and behavioral evals under `agent-scripts/`, with one self-contained folder per artifact. Keep the canonical prompt in that package and use `portfolio/content/scripts/` only for the reader-facing summary and source links. This makes the trust boundary visible and avoids maintaining two prompt copies.
Evidence: `agent-scripts/coding-agent-loop/` contains the canonical prompt, role overlays, README, and 16-case specification; `portfolio/content/scripts/loop-engineering-coding-agent.md` links to those files and the build publishes `/scripts/`.
Use next time: Copy `agent-scripts/_TEMPLATE/`, add eval cases before tuning behavior, then add one portfolio summary entry. Never put prompt text in the executable `scripts/` tree or duplicate the canonical prompt in CMS prose.

## 2026-07-15 - Initial Release

Context: Preparing the repository for its initial public release.
Learning: Compressed the prior learnings log for the initial public launch to keep history clean.
Evidence: Initial commit of the public repository.
Use next time: Document future durable lessons here using this format.

## 2026-07-16 - Copy taste: metrics, third-party tools, and humble voice

Context: Reviewed copy and claims across the site with Ryan. Prior guidance said
"metrics are the spine, use the number," which pushed precise internal
current-employer growth figures (300% users, ~200% API engagement) onto public
pages.
Learning: This is a personal dev brand, not an employer marketing page. Three
taste rules emerged. (1) Metrics: real numbers are fine for public/verifiable
stats (npm downloads), prior-company results, and aged or long-public
current-employer work; recent internal current-employer usage or growth figures
read as internal and sales-pitchy, so use qualitative, understated framing
instead. (2) Third-party tools: name first-party surfaces (AI Studio), never
enumerate competitor AI products (name-brand IDEs, assistants, agent apps), which
reads like tool-shopping or looking for work elsewhere. (3) Voice: default to
"Our team built… I led the strategy and stayed close to the work," crediting
cross-functional partners, without diluting genuinely individual work.
Evidence: Session with Ryan; changes folded into `portfolio-writing`,
`portfolio-review`, and `docs/PORTFOLIO_EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md`.
Use next time: Follow the updated skills and ledger. Keep HITL artifacts (PR and
commit messages) high-level; do not expose internal specifics.
